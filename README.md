# BADarduino
BADarduino is a simple program, written in c#, that converts DuckyScript to Arduino.

## How to use it
Put **BADarduino.exe in the same folder as a input.txt**(the file that contains your DuckyScript) and **run it**.     
**When it's done** (it should be quick) the file **output.ino will be in the directory**.     
### Open source components
**BADarduino** uses the [**Colorful Console**](https://github.com/tomakita/Colorful.Console) library.
