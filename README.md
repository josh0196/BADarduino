# BADarduino
BADarduino is a simple program, written in c#, that converts DuckyScript to Arduino.

##How to use it
Put BADarduino.exe in the same folder as a txt file that contains your DuckyScript called input.txt and run it.
When it's done (it should be quick) the file output.ino will be in the directory.
